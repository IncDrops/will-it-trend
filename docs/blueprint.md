# **App Name**: Trendcast AI

## Core Features:

- AI Trend Forecasting: Accept user input (idea, hashtag, product) and a time horizon, then use AI to forecast its trending potential. The AI tool incorporates current market trends, social buzz, and competitive analysis.
- Trend Result Display: Display the trend forecast result, showing a trend score and rationale.
- Samples Gallery: Showcase sample trend queries and their corresponding forecasts.
- Prediction Results Feed: Display recent anonymous trend queries and results in a dynamic card layout with infinite scroll.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#9D4EDD), chosen to evoke innovation and foresight, fitting for an AI trend forecasting tool. 
- Background color: Light desaturated purple (#F1E5F8), provides a subtle backdrop that emphasizes the glassmorphic and metallic elements. 
- Accent color: Electric blue (#48BFE3), contrasts with the primary color to highlight CTAs and trending scores, adding energy.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), which provides a modern and tech-oriented feel that fits the app's AI focus.
- Implement a fluid, responsive grid with asymmetric card layouts. Cards should have glassy, frosted backgrounds with soft shadows and animated hover effects, some overlapping in the Y-axis for visual interest. Ensure all elements reflow on different devices. No repetitive boring grid.
- Use subtle animated gradients for the trend score/rationale display and shimmering metallic accents for hover and reveal effects. Loading states should include spinners and confetti effects. Focus on smooth transitions to enhance user experience.
